# Dan Martell — ingestion ledger

Tracks processed videoIds so nothing is re-ingested. Verdicts:
`ingested` / `skipped-off-niche` / `skipped-nothing-new`. Depth: `deep` (full
transcript) / `shallow` (title+description fallback).

Note (2026-07-29, shallow pass): the environment's network policy blocked
direct access to youtube.com, so no auto-transcript could be fetched;
judgment was made from the RSS title + description (fetched via Firecrawl).
That run's 3 newest uploads were short-form clips: one on parenting/education
(off-niche), one generic "success habits" motivational short (off-niche per
the routine's own filter), and one AI-tool short whose description was just
the title repeated back with no extractable detail — no wiki update that run.

Note (2026-08-05, deep pass): full transcripts were available this run. The 3
newest uploads had moved on from the prior run's short-form clips to
longer-form business/AI-leverage content — first wiki update logged this run.
