# Mike King (iPullRank) — ingestion ledger

Tracks processed videoIds so nothing is re-ingested. Verdicts:
`ingested` / `skipped-off-niche` / `skipped-nothing-new`. Depth: `deep` (full
transcript) / `shallow` (title+description fallback).

| Date | videoId | Title | Verdict | Depth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-29 | Rqe_4g2cWA8 | SEO Week 2026 \| Zach Chahalis — Why You Need A Relevance Engineer Driving The Car | ingested | shallow |
| 2026-07-29 | fmN6Sw0un7w | SEO Week 2026 \| Garrett Sussman — Run Persona Run | ingested | shallow |
| 2026-07-29 | N4Mdv5t5upc | SEO Week 2026 \| Angela Clark — I Have a Degree for This | skipped-off-niche | shallow |
| 2026-08-05 | JjPfPT37li0 | Your Inbox Might Be the Next AI Search Signal | ingested | deep |
| 2026-08-05 | dTHuLMWDFWo | Search 2026 Halftime Show: What Happened and What's Next (w/ Mike King) | ingested | deep |
| 2026-08-05 | cDuoGFq0hj8 | AI Personalization: How Your Gmail Now Shapes Search Results | skipped-nothing-new | deep |

Note (2026-07-29, shallow pass): the environment's network policy blocks
direct access to youtube.com, so no auto-transcript could be fetched;
judgment was made from the RSS title + full description + chapter markers
(fetched via Firecrawl). `N4Mdv5t5upc` is about professional identity/
psychology under AI disruption, not a niche SEO/GEO tactic. See CHANNELS.md
for a channel-id correction made this run (the `@iPullRank` handle resolves
to Mike King's old personal channel, not the iPullRank company channel where
his current SEO Week / GEO content is actually posted).

Note (2026-08-05, deep pass): `cDuoGFq0hj8` is a short promotional excerpt of
the same Gmail-personalization experiment covered in full in `JjPfPT37li0` —
no new content beyond what's already logged there. No videoId overlap with
the 2026-07-29 run.

Note (2026-09-16): no new videos found this run. Searched the iPullRank
company channel (`UCttOymj_FLE8d7xA7rEbsTw` / @iPullRankSEO) via Firecrawl
(direct youtube.com access was blocked by the environment's network policy
again), including the "Inside SEO Week 2026" playlist and general
site:youtube.com/watch queries — every result found was either already in
this ledger or predates the 2026-07-29 run (the playlist itself was last
updated April 2026). This channel appears to post infrequently; nothing to
ingest this run.
