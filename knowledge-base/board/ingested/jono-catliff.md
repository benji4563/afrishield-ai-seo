# Jono Catliff — ingestion ledger

Tracks processed videoIds so nothing is re-ingested. Verdicts:
`ingested` / `skipped-off-niche` / `skipped-nothing-new`. Depth: `deep` (full
transcript) / `shallow` (title+description fallback).

| Date | videoId | Title | Verdict | Depth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-29 | mGQdB3cMNGE | Anthropic Just Dropped Fable 5: Everything You Need To Know | skipped-off-niche | shallow |
| 2026-08-05 | 8VyHKDSyCCo | Claude Code Local Google Ads: Automate Everything ($730K Earned) | ingested | deep |
| 2026-08-05 | LabRBZp2ODk | Claude Code WordPress SEO: Automate Everything ($500K+ Earned) | ingested | deep |
| 2026-08-05 | 0f3KbpW8TBk | Anthropic Just Dropped Fable 5: Everything You Need To Know | ingested | deep |

Note: `8VyHKDSyCCo` and `LabRBZp2ODk` were first logged 2026-07-29 at `shallow`
depth (both `ingested`); the 2026-08-05 run re-read them at `deep` depth with a
full transcript and produced materially richer wiki entries, so the deep
entries above are what's kept — the shallow duplicates were dropped, not the
underlying videos. `0f3KbpW8TBk` carries the same title as `mGQdB3cMNGE`
(likely a re-upload/duplicate) but is a distinct videoId; the 2026-08-05 run
judged it `ingested` (a routing-rule + agent-safety finding), differing from
the 2026-07-29 run's `skipped-off-niche` call on the other ID — both rows are
kept since they're technically different videoIds.
