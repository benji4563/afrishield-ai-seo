# Julian Goldie — ingestion ledger

Tracks processed videoIds so nothing is re-ingested. Verdicts:
`ingested` / `skipped-off-niche` / `skipped-nothing-new`. Depth: `deep` (full
transcript) / `shallow` (title+description fallback).

Note: depth is `shallow` for all entries — the environment's network policy
blocks direct access to youtube.com (yt-dlp/direct curl get a 403 at the
proxy), so no auto-transcript could be fetched in either run. Judgment was
made from the RSS title + full video description + chapter markers (fetched
via Firecrawl, which reaches YouTube through separate infrastructure). This
channel posts several times a day; only the 3 newest were reviewed per run
per the per-advisor cap. No videoId overlap between the 2026-07-29 and
2026-08-05 runs.
