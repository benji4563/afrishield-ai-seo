# Julian Goldie — ingestion ledger

Tracks processed videoIds so nothing is re-ingested. Verdicts:
`ingested` / `skipped-off-niche` / `skipped-nothing-new`. Depth: `deep` (full
transcript) / `shallow` (title+description fallback).

| Date | videoId | Title | Verdict | Depth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-29 | Zwtorh9Plx0 | Automate Your Entire Lead Pipeline With Hermes | ingested | shallow |
| 2026-07-29 | 3Y0EU6N6ADY | This NEW AI AGENT BEATS CHATGPT 5! | skipped-off-niche | shallow |
| 2026-07-29 | iIU3Daq4LHU | New Gemini Notebook Update is INSANE! | skipped-off-niche | shallow |
| 2026-08-05 | rTSHFy9Lwlg | How I Ranked #1 in 7 Hours with Qwen 3.8 Max (FREE!) | ingested | shallow |
| 2026-08-05 | ut_PeUbmk4c | This NEW Agent Operating System is INSANE! | ingested | shallow |
| 2026-08-05 | PYbBddbflRo | Qwen 3.8 Max is NOW COMPLETELY FREE! Here's How.. | ingested | shallow |

Note: depth is `shallow` for all entries — the environment's network policy
blocks direct access to youtube.com (yt-dlp/direct curl get a 403 at the
proxy), so no auto-transcript could be fetched in either run. Judgment was
made from the RSS title + full video description + chapter markers (fetched
via Firecrawl, which reaches YouTube through separate infrastructure). This
channel posts several times a day; only the 3 newest were reviewed per run
per the per-advisor cap. No videoId overlap between the 2026-07-29 and
2026-08-05 runs.

| 2026-09-16 | OI2by3seeNo | How to Run Hermes Agent FREE Forever! | ingested | deep |
| 2026-09-16 | Tna9xRHRHcI | How to Build Your Own Agent OS FREE | ingested | deep |
| 2026-09-16 | lGBYQqZdly0 | This n8n System Runs My Entire AI Community | ingested | deep |

Note (2026-09-16): direct youtube.com access was blocked by the environment's
network policy again this run, but Firecrawl's YouTube postprocessor returned
full transcripts for all 3 candidates — `deep` depth throughout. All 3 verdicts
carry an unverified-claim caveat per this advisor's "signal not gospel" stance.
